This is a post showing where we are now keeping the company equipment details as well as the company logo. We need these
things to be accessible to all team members from all repos so we have put them here since this is a public repo. Here is
the location of the equipment lists that we use in safety/field planning.

```{r}
readr::read_csv(
  url(
    glue::glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{params$repo_owner}/{params$repo_name}/main/assets/equipment.csv")
  )
)|> 
  fpr::fpr_kable(font = 12)
```
