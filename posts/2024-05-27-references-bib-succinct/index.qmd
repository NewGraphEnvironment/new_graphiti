Here we will clean up a bib file exported from `Zotero` using `R` to contain only the entries found in a `Rmarkdown` file.

```{r}
library(here)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)

# get the name of this post directory
post_dir <- paste0(here::here(), "/posts/", params$post_dir_name)
post_dir_fig <- paste0(post_dir, "/fig/")
```


Let's define our `.bib` files
```{r}
rmd_file <- "~/Projects/repo/fish_passage_peace_2023_reporting/fish_passage_peace_2023_reporting.Rmd"
bib_file <- paste0(here::here(), "/assets/NewGraphEnvironment.bib")
output_file <- "~/Projects/repo/fish_passage_peace_2023_reporting/references.bib"
```


Here are the functions:
```{r}
# Function to extract citations from an RMarkdown file
bib_extract_citations <- function(rmd_file, additional_citations = c()) {
  # Read the entire RMarkdown file
  lines <- readLines(rmd_file)
  
  # Concatenate all lines into a single string
  text <- paste(lines, collapse = " ")
  
  # Regular expression to find citations in the form of @this_citation or [@that_citation; @another_citation]
  citation_pattern <- "@[a-zA-Z0-9_:-]+"
  
  # Extract all citations
  citations <- str_extract_all(text, citation_pattern)[[1]]
  
  # Remove the leading '@' from the citations
  citations <- unique(sub("^@", "", citations))
  
  # Combine with additional citations
  all_citations <- unique(c(citations, additional_citations))
  
  return(all_citations)
}

# Function to clean a BibTeX file to keep only cited entries
bib_clean <- function(bib_file, citations, output_file) {
  file.create(output_file)
  # Read the entire BibTeX file
  lines <- readLines(bib_file)
  
  # Initialize variables
  keep_entry <- FALSE
  cleaned_lines <- c()
  
  for (line in lines) {
    # Check if the line starts a new citation entry
    if (grepl("^@", line)) {
      # Extract the citation key
      citation_key <- sub("^@.*\\{([^,]+),.*", "\\1", line)
      
      # Determine if the entry should be kept
      keep_entry <- citation_key %in% citations
    }
    
    # Add the line to cleaned_lines if the entry is to be kept
    if (keep_entry) {
      cleaned_lines <- c(cleaned_lines, line)
    }
  }
  
  # Write the cleaned lines to the output file
  writeLines(cleaned_lines, output_file)
  
  cat("Cleaned BibTeX file created:", output_file, "\n")
}

```


1. Export our entire library from `Zotero` to a bib file in the `assets` directory of this repo. We don't even change the name of the file.  

As a big part of the motivation to do this is to reduce the bloat in our repositories we will add the default
name of the bib file to the `.gitignore` of this repo.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(post_dir_fig, "Screen Shot 2024-05-27 at 1.40.44 PM.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(post_dir_fig, "Screen Shot 2024-05-27 at 1.40.55 PM.png"))
```



# Write a Cleaned up `.bib` file

We scan a `.Rmd` file for all the references cited within it.  For bookdown projects we use an amalgamated file created during the build.  To be able to access it after the build is complete we need to turn on in the `_bookdown.yml` file by setting the `delete_merged_file: false` option.  This will create a file named whatever is entered in the `book_filename: ` field in that same `_bookdown.yml`.   

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(post_dir_fig, "Screen Shot 2024-05-27 at 1.52.16 PM.png"))
```



One more step:

The `bibtex` referenced extracted from our "mom" `.bib` file (ie. `r basename(bib_file)`) would not include references included in the `nocite` entry of the `index.Rmd` file unless we specifically include them in the function as `additional_citations` - so we need to remember to do that. Let's add one for the sake of demonstration.

```{r}
nocites <- c("busch_etal2013LandscapeLevelModel")
```

## Extract citations from the RMarkdown file
```{r}
# Extract citations from the RMarkdown file
citations <- bib_extract_citations(rmd_file, additional_citations = nocites)

```


## Clean the BibTeX file to keep only cited entries
```{r}
bib_clean(bib_file, citations, output_file)
```


# Gotchas
1. This will not include references included in the `nocite` entry of the `index.Rmd` file unless we specifcally include
them in the function as `additional_citations` so we need to remember to do that.
