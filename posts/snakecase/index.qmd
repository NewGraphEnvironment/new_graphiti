```{r setup, echo=TRUE, include = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, dpi=60, out.width = "100%")
options(scipen=999)
options(knitr.kable.NA = '--') #'--'
options(knitr.kable.NAN = '--')
```


Been preferring `snakecase` naming convention for all files and columns and variables for a long time for the following reasons:

1.  It's much easier to type. Reaching for the shift button is a pain.
2.  Arguably easier to read. I find it easier to read `snake_case` than `CamelCase`.
3.  Can make it easy to `name` things in a fashion that allows you to dissect what something is by the way it is named and allows automatic sorting to group similar things together. This is a good read - https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files-the-sequel . This pays homage to one of my favorite programmers right now who is [Michael Sumner](https://github.com/mdsumner). His tag line on `github` is "no names have an anonymous function".

```{r snake_vs_camel}
#| label: fig-snake_vs_camel
knitr::include_graphics("thumbnail.jpg")
```

Worth noting that `sometimes-rules-need-to-be-broken` sometimes such as when you are naming chunks in `Rmarkdown`. It breaks our `cross-references`.  Luckily as we see here it doesn't matter in `Quarto` (ex. see @fig-snake_vs_camel) vs @fig-all).

```{r all}
#| label: fig-all
knitr::include_graphics("all.jpeg")
```
