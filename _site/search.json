Reaching for the shift button is a pain.\nArguably easier to read. I find it easier to read snake_case than CamelCase.\nCan make it easy to name things in a fashion that allows you to dissect what something is by the way it is named and allows automatic sorting to group similar things together. This is a good read - https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files-the-sequel . This pays homage to one of my favorite programmers right now who is Michael Sumner. His tag line on github is “no names have an anonymous function”.\n\n\n\nCode\nknitr::include_graphics(\"thumbnail.jpg\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nWorth noting that all-rules-need-to-be-broken sometimes such as when you are naming chunks in Rmarkdown and likely Quarto too. It breaks our cross-references (ex see Figure 1) vs Figure 2) when we name our chunks with underscores in them. Fun fact. Good chat.\n\n\nCode\nknitr::include_graphics(\"all.jpeg\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2"
