It's much easier to type. Reaching for the shift button is a pain.\n2.  Arguably easier to read. I find it easier to read `snake_case` than `CamelCase`.\n3.  Can make it easy to `name` things in a fashion that allows you to dissect what something is by the way it is named and allows automatic sorting to group similar things together. This is a good read - https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files-the-sequel . This pays homage to one of my favorite programmers right now who is [Michael Sumner](https://github.com/mdsumner). His tag line on `github` is \"no names have an anonymous function\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"thumbnail.jpg\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](thumbnail.jpg){#fig-snake_vs_camel width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWorth noting that `sometimes-rules-need-to-be-broken` sometimes such as when you are naming chunks in `Rmarkdown`. It breaks our `cross-references`.  \n\n<br>\n\n\nAs we see here though - it doesn't matter in `Quarto` (ex. see @fig-snake_vs_camel) vs @fig-all).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"all.jpeg\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](all.jpeg){#fig-all width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n",
